# Real-Time-Emotion-Detection
A Python-based real-time facial emotion detection system using OpenCV and deep learning (CNNs). This project captures live video through a webcam, detects faces, and classifies emotional states such as happy, sad, neutral, angry, and surprised using a trained convolutional neural network. Ideal for human-computer interactions.
